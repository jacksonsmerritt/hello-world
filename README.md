Hello world!

My name is Jackson Merritt. I am a computer information systems major at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina.
Since I was a child, I could be found tinkering with and taking things apart (and almost putting them back together).
When it comes to computer science, my biggest areas of interest are data management and analysis, cybersecurity,
and optimization/efficency.

I am well rounded in the C/C++ languages, have some practice with HTML/CSS/Javascript, and I am currently learning 
how to program in Java and ARM Assembly. I also enjoy working with old and obscure languages like COBOL, ADA and Fortran.

In my personal time I am always working to expand my knowledge and acquire new skills. I taught myself how to play piano
almost 8 years ago, and have since continued to expand my musical repertoire, learning to play the bass guitar, acoustic and
electric guitar, and harmonica. I also have a passion for learning new languages. I have explored languages like Spanish, German,
Russian and Norwegian in the past, but have recently turned my full attention to learning Finnish.
