# hello-world

My name is Jackson Merritt. I am a senior at Clemson University majority in Managerial Information Systems.
Since I was a child, I could be found tinkering with and taking things apart (and almost putting them back together).
When it comes to computer science, my biggest area of interest is data management and analysis.

I am well rounded in the C/C++ languages, have some practice with HTML/CSS/Javascript, and I am currently learning 
how to program in Java and ARM Assembly. I also enjoy working with old and obscure languages like COBOL, ADA and Fortran.

In my personal time I am always working to expand my knowledge and acquire new skills. I taught myself how to play piano
at a young age and have since continued to expand my instrumental repertoire, learning to play the bass guitar, acoustic and
electric guitar, and harmonica. I also enjoy studying foreign languages. I have explored languages like Spanish, German,
Russian and Norwegian in the past, but have recently turned my full attention to learning Finnish.
