Hello world!

My name is Jackson Merritt. I am a computer science major at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina.
Ever since I was a child, I can be found tinkering with circuitry or computer software in my spare time.
When it comes to computer science, my biggest areas of interest are data management and analysis, cybersecurity,
and program optimization.

I am well rounded in the C/C++ languages, have some practice with HTML/CSS/Javascript, and I am currently learning 
how to program in COBOL.
